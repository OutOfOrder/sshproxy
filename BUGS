0.4 (stable)
* there is still a dependency on ssh for dss key generation (fixed in 0.5).

0.5 (dev)
* If the proxy's public key in known_host does not correspond to what the
  proxy sends, the client exits without a message, and the server thread
  crashes.

* If the public key in the database is not authorized by the server, it
  does not try password authentication.
