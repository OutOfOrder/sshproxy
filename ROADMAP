Please contact me (david@guerizec.net) if you need me to change the priorities.

Legend of pictograms:
    * planned, not yet started
    + work in progress
    - done
    ? need to think about it, may be impossible to do but nice to have
    / task canceled (most probably due to new design)


0.5.0
    - remote sites will be reachable with keys instead of just password
    - make Message protocole more robust
    - backend database schema will be thoroughly simplified with ACLs
    - add a default pkey in site, if the login does not provide one
        Tags make that possible without much work
    - --cipher ciphers private keys in the database
    - backend gain more precise ACLs (access based on IP, hour... plugin ?)
    - make a wizard and a console for the file backend
    - split ebuild in server, client and plugins

0.5.1
    + finish to write good documentation
    + options can be given on the pssh command line (before sites) to be able
      to optionally get rid of the console (list-sites, add-key, get-pssh)
        This Works, but the --add-key is still missing.
    * auto-kill dangling connections, maybe with using keep-alive packets.
    * add a hostkey in site, to check identity of remote site
    * work on automatic remote command execution plugin (spexpect)
    ? make the admin password the cipher key for the solo mode
    ? admin account in the config file

0.6
    * http access to manage the database
    ? "attach" command in the console, to get back to a disconnected session.
