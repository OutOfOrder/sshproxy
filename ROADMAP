This is a living roadmap, it may change without notice from times to times.
Please contact me (david@guerizec.net) if you need me to change the priorities.

Legend of pictograms:
    * planned, not yet started
    + work in progress
    - done
    ? need to think about it, may be impossible to do but nice to have
    / task canceled (most probably due to new design)


0.5.1
    - implement X11 forwarding
    - implement local port forwarding
    - implement remote port forwarding
    + finish to write good documentation
    + options can be given on the pssh command line (before sites) to be able
      to optionally get rid of the console (list-sites, add-key, get-pssh)
        This Works, but the --add-key is still missing.
    + auto-kill dangling connections, maybe with using keep-alive packets.

0.5.2
    * add a hostkey in site, to check identity of remote site
    ? implement openssh VPN proxying
    ? make the admin password the cipher key for the solo mode
    ? admin account in the config file

0.6
    * http access to manage the database
    * work on automatic remote command execution plugin (spexpect)
    ? "attach" command in the console, to get back to a disconnected session.
