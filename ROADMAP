Please contact me (david@guerizec.net) if you need me to change the priorities.

Legend of pictograms:
    * planned, not yet started
    + work in progress
    - done
    ? need to think about it, may be impossible to do but nice to have


0.3.2
    - update installdb to make it work with cipher and config
    - check for mode 600 on config file
    - hide local user passwords in list_users
    - make the auto-add-key feature optional via config
    - encrypt the local users passwords (done with mysql's sha1() function)
    - make it possible to change the password (and key) for users and rlogins

0.4
    - make plugin enabling in config file
    - make a simple file backend
    - rename sshproxy program to sshproxyd and SSHproxy module to sshproxy
    - plugin path (defaults to /usr/lib/sshproxy) in the config file
    - clean installation with setup.py
    - write an ebuild
    - database more coherent (rename columns and tables)
    + replace installdb with an option of sshproxyd (--wizard)
    - replace managedb with an option of sshproxyd (--backend)
    - replace cipherdb with an option of sshproxyd (change passphrase / 
      cipher type) (--cipher)
    - write an init.d script
    - make sshproxyd accept three more options: --daemon, --pid and --user
    ? admin password in the config file
    * update the web site with acks, docs

0.5
    * split ebuild in server, client and plugins
    * make Message protocole more robust
    * profiles gain more precise ACLs (access based on IP, hour... plugin ?)
    + options can be given on the pssh command line (before sites) to be able
      to optionally get rid of the console (list-sites, add-key, get-pssh)
    + profiles will be optionally linked to rlogins
    + cleanup and refactoring of the pwdb module
    * remote sites will be reachable with keys instead of just password
    * make it simpler in mysqlbackend to add user in bulk mode
    ? make the admin password the cipher key for the solo mode

0.6
    * http access to manage the database
    * write good documentation
    * work on automatic remote command execution plugin (spexpect)
