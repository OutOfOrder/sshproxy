About SSHproxy
==============

SSHproxy is a pure python implementation of an ssh proxy.

It allows users to connect to remote sites without having to remember the
password or key of the remote sites.


Why would I need it ?
=====================

If you have a lot of remote servers to administrate, this will relieve you
from doing the boring task of opening your password database, copy-paste the
IP address, copy-paste the password to connect to a remote site. You only have
to know one password (to connect to the proxy) and SSHproxy will do the rest
for you.

Another, more interresting, example: if you're in charge of a lot of remote
sites, and your company has several administrators to do some remote
administration tasks, then no user will ever need to know the password or key
of the servers he administrates. When an employee quit your company, you just
have to delete his entry in the proxy database, and he will never be able to
connect to the remote site. This will protect your business against turn-over.

How does it work ?
==================

SSHproxy is a daemon sitting on one of your server in your LAN or DMZ.

The user connect to it with an ssh client, and the proxy will authenticate
her and check if she's allowed to connect to the remote site.

If she's allowed, the proxy will do the connection to the remote site,
using the password or key stored in its database, and will then connect the
client side channels to the server side channels.

The user is then connected to the remote side, and can do shell commands
and/or scp tranfers almost transparently.

What else do I need to make it work?
====================================

SSHproxy requires:
  - python >=2.3
  - paramiko-1.5.2
  - pycrypto (needed for paramiko)
  - mysql-python

How do I install it ?
=====================

See the file INSTALL at the root directory of the SSHproxy package.

For a fast installation path, just run the installdb script and answer all
the questions. The database will be created for you. Then run ./sshproxy to
launch the daemon.

How do I use it ?
=================

Here is an overview of a normal ssh session:

 me@myhost $ ssh -tp 2242 me@proxy remote-site
 root@remote-site #
 ... doing some administration commands ...
 root@remote-site # exit
 me@myhost $

Here is an example of an scp transfert:

 me@myhost $ scp /etc/issue me@proxy:root@remote-site:/etc/issue.new
 me@myhost $

Here is an overview of multiple connections:

 me@myhost $ ssh -tp 2242 me@proxy
 [proxy::ssh proxy] connect nova
 Last login: Sat Jan 21 17:18:20 2006 from 10.10.4.2
 supernova ~ # ^X
 [proxy::ssh proxy] connect pundit@pundit
 Last login: Mon Jan 23 04:56:24 2006 from 192.168.1.7
 pundit@pundit ~ $ ^X
 [proxy::ssh proxy] list_connections
 0 root@nova
 1 pundit@pundit
 [proxy::ssh proxy] switch 0
 supernova ~ # ^D
 [proxy::ssh proxy] list_connections
 0 pundit@pundit
 [proxy::ssh proxy] back
 pundit@pundit ~ $ ^D
 [proxy::ssh proxy] ^D
 me@myhost $


Here is an overview of the SSHproxy console commands:

 me@myhost $ ssh -tp admin@proxy
 admin@proxy's password: 
 [proxy::ssh proxy] help
